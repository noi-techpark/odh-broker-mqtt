# Flightdata

This project contains configurations and tools to setup a [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) broker with [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

By default, the broker allows anonymous access to a configurable topic and restricted access for a single (configurable) user to a (configurable) restricted topic. Take a look at the  the [env.example](./env.example) file to see how you can configure it.

If you want to provide a custom MQTT configuration (e.g. authentication / authorization), take a look at [Custom MQTT configuration](#custom-mqtt-configuration) section.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-broker-mqtt.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd odh-broker-mqtt/
```

### Execute with Docker

Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the configuration parameters.

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then you can start the MQTT broker using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The service will be available at localhost and your specified server port.

### Custom MQTT configuration

If you want to provide a custom MQTT configuration, you have to do three things:

- target the base image of the provided Dockerfile
- provide your config files when you start Docker Compose
- change the Docker Compose command to start mosquitto with your configuration

> Note: if you provide your own config files, the settings in a `.env` file becomes irrelevant.

The best way to provide your own config is to override the relevant parts in a `docker-compose.override.yml` file (take a look at [https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends) for more info on Docker compose config override).

This project provides a [docker-compose.override.yml.example](./docker-compose.override.yml.example) file that you can use as base.

Copy the file `docker-compose.override.yml.example` to `docker-compose.override.yml` and adjust the configuration parameters.

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
```

provide your config files inside the `./config` folder. Finally, start the MQTT broker using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> Note: just modify the `docker-compose.yml` file if you don't want to handle an additional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.

## FAQ

### Why do I not get feedback when publishing to a topic

In general, if you want to know if publishing to a topic succeeded, subscribe to that topic. All of your published messages should show up in your subscription.

For topics that need authentication, this is not always true. You may be allowed to subscribe to a topic as anonymous, but due to access control restrictions on that topic you may not see your published messages. You may even not notice that publishing did not succeed when you are not allowed to.

If in doubt, please first double check that you use the correct topic and credentials (where necessary). If you still have troubles, please contact our [support](#support).

### Default topics

Given that you don't provide your own mosquitto config (see [Custom MQTT configuration](#custom-mqtt-configuration) on how to do this), mosquitto defines two topics:

- `/open/#`: anyone can subscribe / publish to this topic (anonymous access)
- `flightdata`: special topic with authentication to publish / subscribe flightdata (see [https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-datacollector-flightdata](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-datacollector-flightdata)).
